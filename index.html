<h3>28.11.22, 15:00 CET<br>
Alexander Shen - Kraft-Barmpalias [again] and Gacs-Kucera
</h3>

<p style="width:700px">  Using some remark of Bauwens, one could make the proof of
Kraft-Barmpalias lemma even simpler than I tried to present last time
- we will go again over it, and also show how this can be applied to
prove Gacs-Kucera theorem (every sequence is computable with some random
oracle). (There is still some open question about an improved bound for
oracle use)</p>

<h3>Zoom link will be soon</h3>

<h3>31.10.22, 7.11.22<br>
Pierre Ohlmann - Infinite duration games, memory and graphs</h3>

<p style="width:700px">  In this talk, I will give a broad overview of the field of infinite duration games: why do we care about them, and what are the main open questions. I will then discuss a new approach to making progress on these questions by reducing them to problems about (directed) graphs.</p>

<h3>24.10.22<br>
Alexander Shen -  Kraft, Chaitin and Barmpalias revisited</h3>

<p style="width:700px"> Kraft-Chaitin lemma provides a memory allocation algorithm: it gets a
sequence of integers \(l_1, l_2,\ldots\) such that \(\sum 2^{-l_i} \le 1\), and
returns (in an online fashion) a sequence of incomparable strings
\(x_1,x_2,\ldots\) of the corresponding lengths.</p>

<p style="width:700px"> George Barmpalias generalized this construction and proved and
hierarchical version of this lemma: now the request \(l_i\) can be not only
of the form "give me some new space", but also of the form "give me some
space inside the space allocated for earlier request". This is useful
when we want to construct, for some sequence \(\alpha\), its compressed
version \(\beta\) when the prefixes of \(\beta\) can be decoded to prefixes of
\(\alpha\). There are also some results about possible limits of that type
of compression.

<h3>{3,10}.10.22<br>
Nikolay Vereshchagin -  Algorithmic problems as games.</h3>

<p style="width:700px"> Every algorithmic problem can be understood a certain two-player game with perfect  information. The decidability of the problem means the existence of an algorithm computing a winning strategy in the game. Reductions between problems can also be understood as games of the same type. This approach was developed in the papers of Blass and Japaridze and is an alternative to Medvedev's approach, according to which an algorithmic problems can be identified as a family of total functions and its solution is an algorithm that computes a function from the family.
